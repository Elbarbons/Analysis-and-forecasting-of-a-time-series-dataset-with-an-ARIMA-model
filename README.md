# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with ARIMA

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Analysis and forecasting of a time series dataset with an ARIMA model" and presents an analysis and forecasting project for a time series dataset using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. ARIMA is a popular approach for modeling and predicting time series data, and this project aims to provide insights and predictions for the given dataset.

## Overview

- **Analysis:** Explore the time series data to understand patterns, trends, and potential seasonality.
- **Forecasting:** Utilize the ARIMA model to make predictions for future time points based on historical observations.

## Article

Read the detailed article, that you can find in the documents folder, for insights into the project methodology, findings, and implications.

## Key Features

- **ARIMA Modeling:** Application of the ARIMA algorithm for time series analysis and forecasting.
- **Visualization:** Visual representation of the original time series, model diagnostics, and forecasted values.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Experimentation with ARIMA parameters for optimal model performance.

## Libraries needed

The project is devolep in R, version 2023.03.1 +446.
